# Introduction

Dockerizing POC for the Shipper-Driven Trafffic Simulator app.

## Getting Started

1) Ensure you have docker installed on your device of choice. For Mac, if you're using Docker Desktop - ensure the app is open (Look in Applications) then fire up terminal.
3) Download a copy of the docker-compose.yml to a new folder.
4) Edit the YAML file where the comments are located to suit your use case
5) cd into the newly created folder
6) run `docker compose up -d` and wait for the containers to start
7) browse to http://localhost:8980 (or whatever port you mapped to) and start using STS!
